# Unsupervised Classification of Brookings, South Dakota

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised classification techniques to remotely sensed imagery covering Brookings, South Dakota. The objective is to explore land cover patterns without using labeled training data and to evaluate the spatial structure of the resulting spectral classes.

## Study Area
Brookings, South Dakota, USA.

## Data
Satellite imagery covering the Brookings area was used for this analysis. The data were preprocessed to prepare spectral bands for clustering.

## Methods
Unsupervised classification was implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. The workflow includes:
- Loading and preprocessing satellite imagery
- Applying unsupervised clustering algorithms
- Visualizing classification outputs
- Interpreting resulting land cover patterns

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- rasterio (if applicable)
- matplotlib

## Results
The unsupervised classification identifies distinct spectral clusters that correspond to major land cover types in the Brookings area.
